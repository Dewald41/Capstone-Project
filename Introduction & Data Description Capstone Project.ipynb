The client needs information on what kind of restaurants are the most popular in this surrounding area so that he can make educated decisions. The client believes in delivering the best quality so the amount of competition is not a problem for him.\nThe client would also need some recommended neighbourhoods where the restaurants have a high probability where they would do well in addition to the type of restaurants.\n\n\n## 1.2 Description of problem\n\nLocation data is very valuable in the modern world. Modern cell phones keep track of your geospatial data if your location/GPS settings are enabled. Various apps can keep records of ratings/reviews of companies. These location and ratings data are valuable for the public looking for location- and review data as well as for businessmen. But, how can one use location data to determine popularity and to provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs? This project aims at answering this question."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.1 Description of data\n\nGeospatial data of New York will be used for this project that is stored on the IBM server (https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/newyork_data.jason). The format of the data file is in Jason.\nOnce the neccesary labaries are imported into Python it would be possible to retrieve this geospatial data and retrieve the data that is neccesarry to start the research for the client. To determine what type of restuarants is popular in the surrounding area we can use Python to get this data from the Foursquare website (https://foursquare.com/) by creating an API that can retrieve popularity data from the website. This type of data is valuable for people in the area looking for popular restuarants and good food as well as for entripineurs. \n\n\n## 2.2 How the data would be used\n\nThe geospatial data of neighbourhoods needs to be accessed from the IBM server.\nThe different neighborhoods will then be explored by creating a panda dataframe.\nOnce this dataframe have been created the data can be explored and insights drawn.\nI will use geopy library to get the latitude and longitude values of New York City.\nEach neiborhood can be analyzed to determine the ideal neiborhood that match the client's criteria.\nFoluim will be used to map the various neiborhoods for the presentation.\nAt this stage I will start utilizing the Foursquare API to explore the neighborhoods and segment them.\nEach neighbourhood will be analysed and the most popular restaurants of each neighbourhood will be calculated.\nThe client can choose from these neigborhoods where to open his restaurant.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
